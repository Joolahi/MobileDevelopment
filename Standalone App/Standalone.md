**Standalone app**

I used "eas" to create my old ToDo -app standalone app. I could not use that expo:build, becouse it gave me an error that said: "expo build discontinued on January 4 2023" , but there was a link on eas and i used it. After configuring eas.json to build APKs i make build and it worked well. I also downloaded app on physical mobile phone and send a video about it in this folder.
